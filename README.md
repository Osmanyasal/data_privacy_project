# data_privacy_project
In this project, we implement a CLI(command-line interface) tool that runs various benchmarks and investigates the effects of different anonymization techniques on the performance of given ML algorithms and/or gives meaningful insight to select the most appropriate ML algorithm given an anonymized dataset for a use case.
